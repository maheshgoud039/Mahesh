    <p><b>Hanover</b> is a town in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilQxsj4ipM8">jailer</a>, <a href="/pages/w/136826463006999">Jefferson County</a>, <a href="/pages/w/111957282154793">Indiana</a>, along the <a href="/pages/w/107518682603895">Ohio River</a>. The population was 3,546 at the 2010 census. Hanover is the home of <a href="/pages/w/107672779262309">Hanover College</a>, a small <a href="/pages/w/111659742183260">Presbyterian</a> liberal arts college. Hanover is also the home of <a href="/pages/w/112338532115229">Southwestern High School</a>. The "Point," located on the campus of Hanover College, is the only place along the Ohio River that three bends can be viewed in the river. The tallest waterfall in Indiana, <a href="/pages/w/1943869189162666">Fremont Falls</a>, is located in Hanover.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Logan's Point</h3><p>During the late eighteenth century, the area today known as the state of Indiana was a part of the <a href="/pages/w/110984715596298">Northwest Territory</a>, which originally consisted of the later states of <a href="/pages/w/104024609634842">Ohio</a>, Indiana, <a href="/pages/w/109706309047793">Michigan</a>, <a href="/pages/w/112386318775352">Illinois</a>, <a href="/pages/w/109146809103536">Wisconsin</a>, and parts of <a href="/pages/w/112577505420980">Minnesota</a>. At that time, there were few European settlements on the northern bank of the Ohio River. <a href="/pages/w/109438335740656">Kentucky</a>, on the southern banks of the Ohio, originally included as a part of <a href="/pages/w/109564639069465">Virginia</a>, and in 1792 granted <a href="/pages/w/109424399076333">statehood</a>, was more densely settled by Europeans. It is likely that prior to the early nineteenth-century European settlement of the Hanover area, its predominant inhabitants were <a href="/pages/w/105721139461526">Shawnee</a>.</p>
